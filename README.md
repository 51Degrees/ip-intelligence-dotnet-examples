# ![51Degrees](https://51degrees.com/img/logo.png?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=readme_main&utm_campaign=dotnet-open-source "Data rewards the curious") IP Intelligence Engine Examples

This repository contains the examples for [[ip-intelligence-dotnet](https://github.com/51Degrees/ip-intelligence-dotnet/)].

Projects can be found in the `Examples/` folder. Currently, only on-premise examples are available. See below for a list of examples.

## Cloud (coming soon)

Cloud examples will be added once the cloud service for IP Intelligence becomes available.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Required files

See `ip-intelligence-data/README` ([local](./ip-intelligence-data/README) / [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/ip-intelligence-data/)) on how to pull and/or generate necessary files.

### Mixed Examples Data Files

For the **Mixed examples** that combine Device Detection and IP Intelligence:

1. **IP Intelligence data file**: Place `51Degrees-EnterpriseIpiV41.ipi` (or `51Degrees-LiteV41.ipi`) in the `ip-intelligence-data/` directory at the repository root.

2. **Device Detection data file**: Place `51Degrees-EnterpriseV41.hash` (or `51Degrees-LiteV41.hash`) in the `ip-intelligence-data/` directory at the repository root.

Both data files should be obtained from the respective repositories:
- Device Detection data files: [device-detection-data](https://github.com/51Degrees/device-detection-data)
- IP Intelligence data files: [ip-intelligence-data](https://github.com/51Degrees/ip-intelligence-data)

## üì¶ NuGet Package

Examples currently depend on a pre-release version of the [FiftyOne.IpIntelligence](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FiftyOne.IpIntelligence) package.  

‚ùóMake sure to enable pre-release packages when installing it:
* Using the .NET CLI:
```sh
dotnet add package FiftyOne.IpIntelligence --prerelease
```

* In Visual Studio: check the ‚ÄúInclude prerelease‚Äù box in the NuGet Package Manager UI.

### Mixed Examples

The **Mixed examples** demonstrate how to combine Device Detection and IP Intelligence engines within a single application:

- **Mixed/GettingStarted-Console**: A console application that processes both device detection (from User-Agent) and IP intelligence (from IP address) in parallel using the 51Degrees Pipeline API.

- **Mixed/GettingStarted-Web**: An ASP.NET Core web application featuring:
  - Combined device detection and IP intelligence results in a two-column layout
  - IP address lookup functionality with custom IP input
  - Client-side evidence collection for enhanced device detection
  - Client hints support for improved browser detection
  - All device detection and IP intelligence properties displayed
