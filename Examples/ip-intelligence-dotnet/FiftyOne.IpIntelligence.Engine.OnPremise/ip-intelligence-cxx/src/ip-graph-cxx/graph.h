 *
 * All the functions specific to the IP Intelligence Graph.
 * @{
 * 
 * Evaluates an IP address and component id to determine the index associated 
 * with the profile or profile group from the related component.
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * fiftyoneDegreesIpiGraphCreateFrom[Memory|File] should be used to create an
 * array of component graph information records from a suitable data source.
 * 
 * This array is past to the fiftyoneDegreesIpiGraphEvaluate function along
 * with the IP address and the id of the component required. The following code
 * would be used to obtain the result for component id 1 and IP address 
 * 51.51.51.51.
 * 
 *	Exception exception;
 *	uint32_t result = 0;
 *	const char* ipAddress = "51.51.51.51";
 *	IpAddress parsedIpAddress;
 *	parsedIpAddress.type = 0;
 *	if (IpAddressParse(
 *		ipAddress,
 *		ipAddress + sizeof(ipAddress), 
 *		&parsedIpAddress)) {
 *		result = fiftyoneDegreesIpiGraphEvaluate(
 *			wrapper->array,
 *			(byte)1,
 *			parsedIpAddress,	
 *			&exception);
 *	}
 * 
 * The IP address is parsed from a string into a IpAddress instance using the
 * common-cxx IP functions.
 * 
 * The array created must be freed with the fiftyoneDegreesIpiGraphFree method
 * when finished with.
 * 
 * ## Note
 * 
 * The methods marked trace are for 51Degrees internal purposes and are not
 * intended for production usage.
 * 
 * Associated tests are not provided as open source. Contact 51Degrees if more
 * information is required.
