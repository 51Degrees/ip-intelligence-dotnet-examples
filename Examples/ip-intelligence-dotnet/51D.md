## Enable debugging of NuGet packages

In order to debug into NuGet packages, you must be using packages that reference debug symbols. By default, this includes all pre-release packages but not final versions.
If you have a debuggable package then you will need to configure Visual Studio to allow you to step into it:

- In tools -> options -> debugging -> symbols, add the Azure DevOps symbol server: 
![Visual Studio 2019 screenshot with symbol server added][ImageAddSymbolServer]
- Select the ‘Load only specified modules’ option at the bottom and configure it to only load Symbols for 51Degrees modules as shown below:
![Visual Studio 2019 configured to only load external symbols for 51Degrees libraries][ImageLoadOnlyFiftyone]
- In tools -> options -> debugging -> general, ensure that:
  - Enable Just My Code is off. Having this on will prevent VS stepping into any NuGet packages.
  - Enable source server support is on.
  - Example Source Link support is on.

When stepping into a method from a relevant NuGet package, you should now see the following warning message:

## Generating SWIG classes with UTF8 marshaler

IP Intelligence use UTF-8 encoded strings instead of ASCII. Thus, for SWIG interface to correctly handle the UTF-8 encoding, the followings are required in addition to the normal SWIG generating process:
- A UTF-8 marshaler class.
- Update SWIG csharp/std_string.i to use this marshaler instead of the default.

We have produced a UTF-8 marshaler which is located under FiftyOne.IpIntelligence/FiftyOne.IpIntelligence.Engine.OnPremise/Interop/Marshaler. For SWIG to pick this up, the std_string.i needs to be updated by:
- Removing the line
  ```
  %typemap(imtype) string "string"
  ```
  with:
  ```
  %typemap(imtype, inattributes="[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.CustomMarshaler, MarshalTypeRef = typeof(UTF8Marshaler))]", outattributes="[return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.CustomMarshaler, MarshalTypeRef = typeof(UTF8Marshaler))]") string "string"
  ```
  and the line
  ```
  %typemap(imtype) const string & "string"
  ```
  with:
  ```
  %typemap(imtype, inattributes="[MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.CustomMarshaler, MarshalTypeRef = typeof(UTF8Marshaler))]", outattributes="[return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.CustomMarshaler, MarshalTypeRef = typeof(UTF8Marshaler))]") string & "string"
  ```
  - These will add the in/out ``MarshalAs`` attributes to any method/function that use ``string`` to indicate that the UTF-8 marshaler should be used instead.

Once the SWIG C# files have been generated, where the ``MarshalAs`` attribute is required, the namespace ``System.Runtime.InteropServices`` will need to be added (e.g. ``IpIntelligenceEngineModulePINVOKE`` class).
```
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
```
