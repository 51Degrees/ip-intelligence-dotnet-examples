/// <summary>
/// @example Cloud/Metadata-Console/Program.cs
///
/// The Cloud service exposes meta data that can provide additional information about the various 
/// properties that might be returned.
/// This example shows how to access this data and display the values available.
/// 
/// A list of the properties will be displayed, along with some additional information about each
/// property. Note that this is the list of properties used by the supplied resource key, rather
/// than all properties that can be returned by the Cloud service.
/// 
/// In addition, the evidence keys that are accepted by the service are listed. These are the 
/// keys that, when added to the evidence collection in flow data, could have some impact on the
/// result that is returned.
/// 
/// Bear in mind that this is a list of ALL evidence keys accepted by all products offered by the 
/// cloud. If you are only using a single product (for example - device detection) then not all
/// of these keys will be relevant.
/// 
/// This example is available in full on [GitHub](https://github.com/51Degrees/ip-intelligence-dotnet-examples/blob/main/Examples/Cloud/Metadata-Console/Program.cs). 
/// 
/// To run this example, you will eventually need to create a Resource Key, but for now you should use the GettingStarted-API example - just run it and point this example to its custom endpoint to simulate a custom hosted Cloud service. Resource Key is used as shorthand to store the particular set of properties you are interested in as well as any associated License Keys that entitle you to increased request limits and/or paid-for properties, but it is not yet available for IP Intelligence.
