    # vstest's blame collector aborts the whole assembly - and writes a multi-GB
    # hang dump - once a single test goes this long without a test-case event.
    # Its timer resets only on TestCaseStart/TestCaseEnd, so a legitimately long
    # test cannot hold it off by logging progress; console output does not touch
    # it.
    #
    # This is the only per-test ceiling that actually applies here. The
    # TestTimeout in Tests/test.runsettings does not: the filter above selects
    # built assemblies, so common-ci runs "dotnet test <assembly>.dll
    # --no-build", which never goes through MSBuild and so never turns the
    # projects <RunSettingsFilePath> into --settings. (common-ci has a fallback
    # that looks for a test.runsettings, but it probes the process directory
    # rather than the repository, and ours lives under Tests/ regardless. The
    # same gap is written up in device-detection-dotnet/ci/run-integration-tests.ps1.)
    # Below blame there is nothing, and above it only the job timeout.
    #
    # common-ci defaults this to 5m, which is exactly the budget
    # Example_OnPremise_MetricsConsole gives itself before cancelling. That test
    # always spends its budget in full, so every leg finished within a second of
    # the deadline and the two raced; the slower macOS runners lost it
    # consistently and took the nightly red.
    #
    # 12m is ~2.4x the longest test observed (MetricsConsole, 5m), leaving blame
    # as a genuine-hang backstop rather than something the suite trips in normal
    # operation. Sibling repo ip-intelligence-dotnet raises it for the same
    # reason. Raising the budget in TestExamples.cs means revisiting this.
